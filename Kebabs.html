    <h1>KEBABS</h1>
    <p>Served as a snack or appetizer, there are many types of kebabs in Pakistani cuisine.

        Thereâ€™s the popular seekh kebab, which is ground meat grilled on skewers.
        
        We also recommend the chapli kebab so called because it is thought to be shaped like a chappal (sandal)  and the shami kebab, which features small patties made with minced meat mixed with split chickpeas, finely chopped onion, mint, green chilli and egg to hold it all together.</p>
