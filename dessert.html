    <h1>DESSERT</h1>
    <P>Also known as gajar ka halwa, this dish is made using a combination of grated carrots, nuts, milk, sugar and
        clarified butter.

        Best served with a scoop of ice cream on the side, this flavorful but light dessert often makes an appearance at
        weddings and parties.

        Traditionally served on special occasions, this brightly colored sweet rice is a Pakistani favorite.

        Made with sugar, milk, food coloring and flavored with cardamoms, raisins, pistachios and almonds, zarda is
        either yellow or made with various food colorings to give it a multicolor effect.</P>
